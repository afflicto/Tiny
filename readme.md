Tiny is a tiny (600 lines of js) framework for building simple front-end applications.

##Features

* Renders views/templates via regular HTML elements.
* Module-based (App, Router Store are the default ones)
* Pretty easy to use. At least I think so, maybe just because I wrote it...
* Only dependancy is jQuery.
* Written in CoffeScript.

## Development
To develop, you need:

* npm
* gulp
* [W/M/L]AMP stack, or something else.. but you need PHP to run the example. And mod_rewrite, if you use apache that is.

Clone the git repo, then run `npm install`. Then run `gulp`.
Make sure you clone the git repo in a place accessible by your local web root, the example directory contains an index.php
